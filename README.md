# Data-Mining-Project

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model, training on the dataset containing 2500 rows and 68 attributes.
Prediction on the test data of dimension 1647 * 68 which can further be used to calculate balanced error rate.
Supervising techniques like SVM, Random Forest Ensemble, Bootstrapping, etc. are used to obtain best training error before making predictions.
